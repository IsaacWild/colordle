Wordle but you got to guess the RGB values of the given color!

I plan to make this very basically to start with and have it as a small side project as I go along my web dev training going through the Odin project.

To start it will only have the option to guess the RGB value but I plan to expand to HSL, HSV, CMYK and HEX as bonus rounds/options?
